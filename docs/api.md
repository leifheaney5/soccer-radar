# API reference

Public JSON endpoints require no client authentication. Expensive routes are protected by a bounded per-process rate limiter. Every response receives `X-Request-ID`; versioned API errors include the same request ID.

## Canonical fixture API

### `GET /api/v2/fixtures`

Query parameters:

- `date`: required format `YYYY-MM-DD`; defaults to the server's current date.
- `timezone`: IANA timezone such as `America/New_York`; defaults to `UTC`.

Unknown parameters return `400 invalid_request`. Invalid dates and timezones return `400` with typed error codes.

Successful response shape:

`whereToWatch` is an additive, render-ready list of the fixture's reported TV
and streaming options. `type` is `TV` or `STREAMING`; provider names and
reported regions come from the source. Options derived from provider broadcast
data include `id`, `displayName`, `officialUrl`, `region`, `regionKnown`,
`type`, `source`, `sourceId`, and `observedAt`; `logoPath` is optional. For a
name that does not match the verified service registry, `id` and `officialUrl`
are `null`, `displayName` remains the provider-reported name, and no logo path
is supplied. Options added by the scheduled official-source refresh carry the
same identity fields plus `status` (`available` or `stale`) and may omit
`regionKnown`; their `sourceId` names the source (`espn-broadcasts`,
`official-competition-listings`, `uefa-where-to-watch`, `fifa-plus-live`, or
`concacaf-where-to-watch`).
The legacy `streaming` array remains streaming-only and preserves its existing
entry shape. When registry enrichment is enabled, every fixture includes
`whereToWatch`; an empty list means no supported TV or streaming entries were
returned in the provider data. Older payloads may omit the field, as may
responses when enrichment is disabled. Neither an empty list nor an omitted
field asserts that the fixture is unavailable on TV or online. `broadcastCoverage.status` is `available`,
`confirmed_none`, `unverified`, or `stale`; `regions` carries the same state for
each known region. `confirmed_none` is reserved for an eligible source that
confirms complete coverage. The response-level report measures source
freshness and 30-day competition/region coverage; “covered” requires
complete-source evidence for at least 90% of fixtures. Official links open the
provider's homepage; the ESPN broadcast feed does not supply a match-specific
viewing URL. Clients may persist a region preference locally; the default is
all reported regions.

### `POST /api/internal/broadcast-refresh`

Hourly GitHub Actions refresh. Requires `Authorization: Bearer <OPS_ADMIN_TOKEN>`.
It uses the existing operations token and shared Redis cache, and returns
refresh status, source metrics, and the last observation timestamp. Provider
failure preserves the previous snapshot and reports it stale; public fixture
requests do not invoke this route. Stale/unavailable refreshes return `503`
so the scheduled workflow can report upstream refresh failures.

Valid states are `success`, `empty_confirmed`, `partial`, and `stale`. Total provider failure returns `503 provider_unavailable`; a provider-limited total failure or application burst limit returns `429 rate_limited` with `Retry-After`.

### `GET /api/v2/fixtures/{canonicalFixtureId}`

Returns a recently cached canonical fixture as `{"fixture": ...}`. Invalid IDs return `400`; expired or unknown links return `404`.

### `GET /api/v2/search`

Global search is feature-gated and enabled by default. When disabled by an
operator, the route returns `404`. It accepts
`q` (at least two characters), an optional IANA `timezone`, optional inclusive
`start` and `end` dates, and `limit`/`offset` pagination. The date window is
bounded to seven days and defaults to three days before through three days after
the current server date.

Results are typed `team`, `competition`, or `fixture` records with stable IDs.
Fixture results contain status and teams but never score fields. A provider
failure for one day preserves successful days and returns `state: "partial"`
with per-day states. The endpoint returns `404` while the `search` feature flag
### `GET /api/v2/teams/{canonicalId}/analysis`

Temporarily unavailable while Team Intelligence is disabled. The route returns the generic `404 not_found` envelope until the feature is re-enabled.

### `GET /api/v2/capabilities`

Returns typed `supported`, `unavailable`, or `not_supported` states for provider-gated features. Unsupported results contain a reason and never a synthetic `data` field.

## Health and build

- `GET /health/live`: process liveness.
- `GET /health/ready`: dependency wiring, exact build, and cache readiness/degradation.
- `GET /health/version`: version, full commit SHA, build timestamp, environment, and asset token.
- `GET /health/metrics`: in-process counters and timing aggregates; no raw requests or credentials.

## Page and export routes

- `/`, `/matches-today`: fixture dashboard.
- `/calendar`: bounded seven-day calendar.
- `/fixtures/{id}`: canonical dashboard deep-link redirect.
- `/fixtures/{id}.ics`: score-free RFC 5545 event.
- `/teams`, `/teams/{canonicalId}`: reserved Team Intelligence routes; currently return `404` while the feature is disabled.
- `/competitions/{canonicalId}`: stable competition page.
- `/league-tables`: consent-gated third-party table embed.
- `/privacy`, `/data-sources`, `/offline`: product information and offline shell.
- `/operations`: restricted read-only operations dashboard; live data requires
  the `X-Ops-Token` header through `/api/v2/operations` when configured.

Legacy `/api/competitions`, `/api/teams/{id}`, `/api/team/{id}`, `/api/team-analysis/{id}`, and `/api/matches-today` remain for compatibility; team-analysis routes currently return `404` while Team Intelligence is disabled. New clients should prefer `/api/v2` because legacy errors and provider-shaped response fields are not the canonical contract.
