# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Public `/support` page with the `support@trequa.io` contact, what to include
  in a report, and answers about hidden scores, unverified watch listings, and
  kickoff times; linked from the footer, listed in the sitemap, and used as the
  App Store support URL (`clients/ios/fastlane/metadata/en-US/support_url.txt`).
- Feature-gated global search across bounded upcoming/recent fixtures, teams,
  and competitions with score-free results, keyboard navigation, and a
  mobile full-screen surface.
- Read-only operations dashboard and token-protected operations summary API
  for build, readiness, provider, rate-limit, and metrics signals.
- Official broadcast-source inventory for UEFA, FIFA+, and Concacaf, plus a
  fixture-level observation adapter with exact matching, HTTPS domain checks,
  ambiguity handling, and coverage metrics.
- Per-fixture TV and streaming listings with provider names, verified official
  links, reported regions, and a clear state when no listing was supplied.
- Native SwiftUI fixture navigation, local filtering, spoiler-safe detail/settings
  surfaces, route-driven fixture Universal Links, adaptive accessibility-size
  rows, and TestFlight release metadata.
- App Store submission lanes now stop before building when legal Terms
  placeholders or a verified support URL are still missing.
- Submission preflight also runs the shared repository release-asset validator,
  preventing manual lanes from bypassing metadata and CI-contract checks.
- Signed archive lanes now fail before building when Apple identifiers, App
  Store Connect credentials, or the numeric build number are missing; simulator
  tests remain explicitly signing-free.
- Mobile fixture filter sheets, safe-area handling, focus management, 200%/400%
  reflow coverage, release asset/CI validation, beta-note lane wiring, and
  stable WebKit match-sheet focus restoration.

### Changed

- Rebranded the web and native client as Soccer Radar, made
  `soccer-radar.com` canonical, and preserved old-domain routes and Universal
  Links.
- Retried failed initial fixture loads and showed an explicit unavailable state with automatic recovery.
- Centered and aligned the shared footer, adding copyright and version metadata
  across the responsive application shell.
- Tightened fixture-row spacing and kept venue text on the same desktop row as the match result.
- Moved verified streaming information beside fixture scores and removed the separate On TV filter.
- Improved fixture presentation with compact date browsing, stronger live-state hierarchy, optional venue/stage metadata, and verified on-TV filtering.
- Added crawl-safe WebSite and BreadcrumbList structured data without exposing
  spoiler-sensitive scores.
- Added an evidence-led marketing workspace with explicit prohibited claims
  for coverage, rights, accuracy, and real-time behavior.
- Fixture cards, featured fixtures, match details, source freshness, summaries,
  calendar days, and fixture deep links now use the explicitly selected IANA
  timezone. Selected fixtures remain open when a timezone change crosses a
  local calendar date.
- Calendar days now retain independent loading, empty, partial, stale, and
  provider-error states; score visibility rerenders cached days without network
  requests. Provider fan-out is concurrent under one shared deadline.
- Canonical status labels now distinguish first half, second half, half time,
  extra time, penalties, delayed, suspended, abandoned, and terminal outcomes.
  Verified streaming listings have bounded local icons with safe generic
  fallbacks.
- Standings configuration now includes competition season type and review
  deadlines, warning on rollover mismatches rather than silently trusting old
  provider IDs.
- ESPN team normalization now preserves official crests from both singular and
  collection-based provider logo fields, with ESPN's official default team logo
  when no crest exists. Team Intelligence is temporarily disabled across web,
  native, and API entry points.
- Competition group headers now preserve official provider emblems and use the
  friendly-category mark when a friendly competition has no supplied emblem.
- Live is now represented by the fixture status filter rather than a duplicate
  top-level navigation destination.
- Increased the bounded ESPN provider response guard to 5 MB so current global
  scoreboard payloads are accepted without removing response-size protection.
- Provider fan-out now shares one request budget, and stale ESPN metadata preserves
  usable fixtures while reporting a partial outcome.
- The privacy page now documents native iOS score-preference, request-ID, and
  analytics behavior; the native app root explicitly imports the Observation
  module required by its observable composition root.
- iOS CI now selects simulators using numeric runtime versions through a tested,
  dependency-free helper instead of lexicographic inline parsing.
- iOS CI now also runs when its shared release validator or Terms preflight input
  changes, keeping release-gate edits from bypassing macOS verification.
- Generated Xcode projects/user state are ignored, iOS workflow permissions are
  read-only, and CI jobs have explicit timeouts.
- Native fixture detail now shares score visibility with the list and exposes an
  explicit reveal/hide control without weakening the launch-hidden default.
- Native fixture detail now preserves every provider-reported broadcast entry,
  labels streaming versus broadcast listings, and shows supplied regions without
  implying availability.

## 2.0.0 - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Canonical versioned fixture API with typed provider and data-quality outcomes.
- ESPN and optional Football-Data.org adapters, shared Redis cache boundary, bounded memory fallback, rate limiting, request IDs, metrics, and immutable build identity.
- Spoiler-safe responsive fixture dashboard, adaptive live refresh, match and team context, local favorites, seven-day calendar, canonical links, and score-free calendar exports.
- Source/freshness inspector, privacy and data-source pages, secure headers, metadata, PWA installability, and spoiler-sanitized offline snapshots.
- Provider capability manifest and production-grade Python, Chromium, WebKit, axe, load, visual, audit, and live-smoke workflows.
- Durable PostgreSQL fixture identity/provider-alias registry with Alembic migration, stable kickoff-independent public IDs, alias-preserving deep links, and protected unresolved-mapping diagnostics.
- Dependency-aware production readiness and explicit Railway migration, start, health-check, restart, backup, and recovery operations.

### Changed

- Replaced provider-shaped fixture rendering and ambiguous empty/error fallbacks with canonical deterministic contracts.
- Made `main` production releases verifiable through full Git SHA and build-derived asset tokens.
- Prevented conflicting same-provider events and duplicate public fixture IDs from merging or overwriting fixture lookup entries.

### Deferred

- Events, lineups, detailed match statistics, broadcast listings, and notifications require legitimate sources and, for notifications, explicit consent and delivery infrastructure.
- Football-Data.org squad and standings capabilities remain unavailable where no API key is configured.
