# Soccer Radar

Soccer Radar 2.0 is a spoiler-safe football fixture workspace built with Flask
and vanilla JavaScript. The production site is
[soccer-radar.com](https://soccer-radar.com); `soccerscanner.pro` remains active
for old links and redirects content to the matching new-domain route.

## What it does

- Scans fixtures by local calendar date and IANA timezone through ESPN's global soccer scoreboard, including every competition present in that provider response rather than a fixed league shortlist.
- Keeps every score out of rendered DOM and accessibility content until the visitor explicitly reveals scores.
- Groups fixtures by competition with canonical team identities, crest fallbacks, deterministic de-duplication, source freshness, and data-quality evidence.
- Provides shareable filter and fixture URLs, a seven-day calendar, spoiler-free `.ics` exports, session-scoped score visibility, and explicitly gated league-table embeds. It is guest-only: there are no accounts, persistent favorites, saved defaults, or cross-device synchronization.
- Represents success, confirmed empty, partial, stale, rate-limited, and unavailable provider outcomes truthfully.
- Runs as an installable PWA. Offline fixture snapshots omit live fixtures and recursively remove scores before storage.

## Runtime architecture

The browser calls the versioned canonical endpoint `GET /api/v2/fixtures`. Flask coordinates typed ESPN and optional Football-Data.org adapters through a bounded provider deadline. Results are normalized, assigned durable provider-qualified identities, merged, cached, and filtered back to the requested local date. PostgreSQL persists public IDs and aliases. Redis provides shared cache and single-flight coordination; bounded in-memory SQLite/cache fallbacks are development-only and block production readiness.

See [architecture](docs/architecture.md), [API contract](docs/api.md), [data sources](docs/data-sources.md), [provider mapping](docs/provider-mapping.md), and [provider capabilities](docs/provider-capabilities.md).

## Local development

Requirements:

- Python 3.12
- Node.js 22 and npm 10

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm ci
Copy-Item .env.example .env
python app.py
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. ESPN fixture coverage works without a credential. `FOOTBALL_DATA_API_KEY` is optional and enables declared Football-Data.org capabilities. Never commit `.env`.

## Configuration

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `FOOTBALL_DATA_API_KEY` | Optional team, squad, and standings provider credential | unset |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Durable fixture identity and alias registry | in-memory SQLite outside production |
| `REDIS_URL` | Shared production cache and cross-worker single-flight | memory fallback outside production |
| `OPS_ADMIN_TOKEN` | Bearer token for protected identity diagnostics | unset |
| `DATABASE_POOL_*` | Bounded SQL connection-pool controls | values in `.env.example` |
| `APP_ENVIRONMENT` | Build/runtime environment; production requires a commit SHA | Railway environment or `development` |
| `APP_VERSION` | Semantic application version override | package version |
| `GIT_COMMIT_SHA` | Exact deployed Git revision | Railway commit SHA fallback |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | Canonical public origin | `https://soccer-radar.com` |
| `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` | Number of trusted reverse-proxy hops | `1` |
| `PORT` | HTTP port | `5000` |
| `WEB_CONCURRENCY` | Gunicorn workers | `2` |

The remaining timeout, cache, rate-limit, and provider bounds are defined in `soccer_scanner/config.py`. See [deployment](docs/deployment.md), [Railway architecture](docs/railway-architecture.md), and the [Railway runbook](docs/railway-runbook.md).

## Tests

```powershell
$env:PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD='1'
python -m pytest -q
python -m compileall -q app.py wsgi.py soccer_scanner
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium webkit
npm test
```

CI also checks every JavaScript file, serious/critical axe violations, dependency audits, committed secrets, concurrent cache/provider behavior, and synthetic visual-state artifacts. See [testing](docs/testing.md).

The task ledger in `todo.md` maps each task to `check.sh`. Run a focused check
with `bash ./check.sh T###` (or `bash ./check.sh all` for the full ledger);
each run records command output and its result in `.checks/logs/`. Use
`bash ./check.sh T### --mark` only to mark a task whose check passes.

## Production verification

After Railway reports terminal `SUCCESS`, verify the exact revision rather than inferring deployment from Git:

```powershell
$env:BASE_URL='https://soccer-radar.com'
$env:EXPECTED_SHA=(git rev-parse HEAD)
npm run smoke:production
```

The smoke checks root/live/ready/version, exact SHA and asset tokens, the fixture success/error contract, first-party asset and console failures, default hidden-score safety, and 320 px reflow.

## Privacy and boundaries

Score visibility is session-scoped and starts hidden in each new session; no user accounts, persistent favorites, saved defaults, or cross-device synchronization exist. Timezone, date, filters, and selected fixture state may be URL-backed. Legacy browser favorite keys are not read. Events, lineups, detailed statistics, and notifications remain unavailable until legitimate providers and required consent infrastructure exist. Streaming services are shown only when a provider reports them for a fixture; each service's region is shown when the provider supplies one and labelled "Region unknown" otherwise; links point only at a service's own official homepage, never a guessed URL, and are omitted entirely for any service the app cannot verify. No match streams are hosted or provided by this application.
